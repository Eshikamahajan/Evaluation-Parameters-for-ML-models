# Evaluation-Parameters-for-ML-models
Collecetion of Basic Parameters like accuaracy etc for evaluating the models 

# Model Evaluation
Model evaluation aims to estimate the generalization accuracy of a model on future (unseen/out-of-sample) data. Where we have different techniques to predict the data, its accuracy and other evaluation parameters helps in selecting the best ML Algorithm to be used.

# About Eval_param.py
This code is used for model evaluation that uses confusion matrix as a criteria (in classification) and basic parameters like accuracy,rmse etc for the regression problems.
